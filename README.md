# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION
# 💳 Credit Card Fraud: Analysis and Prevention
# 🔍 Overview
Credit card fraud poses a growing risk to financial systems and consumer trust. This project analyzes transaction patterns to detect fraud using machine learning and aims to develop strategies for prevention.

# 📊 Dataset Summary
The dataset contains 100,000 simulated credit card transactions with the following key features:

**TransactionID**: Unique transaction reference

 **TransactionDate**: Timestamp of the transaction

**Amount**: Transaction value

**MerchantID**: Identifier for the merchant

**TransactionType**: Purchase or refund

**Location**: Geographic data

**IsFraud**: Target label (1 = fraud, 0 = legitimate)

# 🎯 Objectives
 **EDA**: Analyze distributions, detect trends, and understand fraud occurrence.

**Pattern Detection**: Use clustering and correlation analysis to find anomalies.

**Fraud Detection Models**: Build and evaluate ML models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

**Feature Importance**: Identify key factors contributing to fraud prediction.

# 💡 Solutions Explored
